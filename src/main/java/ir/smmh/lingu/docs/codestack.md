## `Codestack`

[`Codestack.java`](Codestack.java) :arrow_forward:

Codestack is the CLI of the lingu project. As its name suggests, it lets the user interact with a stack on
which [codes](codes.md#code) and other related objects can be pushed. If the object on top of the stack is
a [view](../vis/viewing.md#view), a minimalistic GUI called the [viewer](../vis/viewing.md#viewer) can be invoked to
view it.

Textual commands can be used to push objects of different types on stack. Some commands operate on the top object
without pushing anything. Some commands will require string arguments. Make sure to enclose them in only double
quotations or not at all; single quotations do not work.

The available commands vary depending on the type of the object on top of the stack:

| Top object                                     | Command                    | Description                                                                                                       | Effect |
